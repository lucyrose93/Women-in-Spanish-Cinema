    An overview of the key themes in my final year dissertation, <strong>"Experiencing the XX in the Spanish Psychological Thriller"</strong>, where "XX" is a two-fold reference encapsulating female chromosomes and X-rated viewing. </br><strong>Thesis</strong>: Male-centric representations of female biology and atavistic stereotypes belying male psychosexual development are viscerally exploited and exaggerated in contemporary Spanish horror cinema, harking back to the misogyny and violence of Franco's era in Hitchcockean style, while nonetheless gaining <a href = "#">universal appeal</a>.

  <h2><em>Los otros</em>(Amenabar 2001)</h2>
    <p>
     "<em>Los Otros</em> (<em>The Others</em>) was the box-office hit of 2001, confirming the domestic and international banakability of Amenabar. It became the highest-grossing product in the history of Spanish cinema" (L-R: 199).</br>We can only guess at how much Los otros owes its success to the fact that it was shot in English, making it more accessible to an anglophone audience, even though Amenabar originally wrote the screenplay in Spanish with a Spanish cast in mind. 
      <br>
        The plotline of The Others had a profound impact upon Spanish Horror/Psychological Thrillers in the years that followed. The narrative centres upon a mother (Nicole Kidman) who embarks upon a Daunting Quest to uncover a Terrible Truth in an Isolated Location. As demonstrated by "Women in Spanish Horror Film", this trope has since been recycled ritualistically, most explicitly in films such as <em>El orfanato</em> (Bayona 2007) and <em>Hierro</em> (Ibanez 2009), although it is also a feature of <em>Mientras Duermes</em> (Balaguero 2011) and <em>Los ojos de Julia</em>(Morales 2011). 
         <blockquote>
           <em>The Others</em> set a precedent for Spanish filmmakers of the 21st Century to follow.

  <h2><em>El orfanato</em> (Bayona 2007)</h2> 
    <p>This spooky tale about a mother's desperate quest to find her son "launched the career of Bayona" (L-R: 199). This was no doubt thanks to the artistic and industrial patronage of Mexican powerhouse, director Guillermo del Toro, who took Bayona under his wing. As a result, <em>El orfanato</em> - <em>The Orphanage</em> in English - "outperformed Holloywood products [...] by grossing 25 million euros" (ibid: 199). 
      <br>
        <blockquote>
          Through a calculated - some might say aggressive - marketing strategy, <em>El orfanato</em> attracted more mainstream audiences. The deliberately crafted ambiguity of the plot and its elegant synthesis of <em>The Innocents</em>, <em>The Others</em>, and <strong>every other cinematic chiller about a woman's psychic fixation with some not-so-innocent children</strong> blended melodrama and ghost story and found a broad audience beyond the horror genre crowd (ibid: 230)
            </blockquote>
              <em>The Orphanage</em> was a beacon for Spanish horror on the international horizon. Yet its widespread success can perhaps be attrubuted to its use of "production values usually associated with Hollywood products" (ibid: 227). <br><br>
                <strong>The Haunted House Genre</strong>
                  <br>
                    Indeed, Bayona claims that the film is shot "classically" (i.e. <em>the American Way</em>), with echoes of <em>The Innocents</em> and <em>The Haunting</em> (ibid: 228). As L-R notes, "[t]he film unabashedly makes use of a <strong>classic haunted house production design to convey the giref, distress and madness germinating in the female protagonist's psyche</strong>" (ibid: 228). Not unlike <em>The Haunting</em>, the domestic environment of the orphanage itself presents a key protagonist, animated by the presence of the ghost children. <br><br>
                      <strong>The Threatening Exterior</strong><br>
                        According to L-R, "the ominous skyline with the pre-credit sequence opens sets the mood of the film" (ibid: 228). Shots of the large expanses of sky, tracts of barren coastline, and marine horizons are repeated throughout the film. These are interspersed with long-shots which dwarf and overwhelm our protagonists, particularly when Laura and Simon first venture to the beach together. We have a sense of their powerlessness, intermingled with a hunch that they are being watched from afar, by someone or something who wishes to remain anonymous.<br><br>
                          <strong>The Mother-Son Relationship </strong><br>
                            As is the case in so many horror/thriller films, the strained Mother-Son Relationship lies at the crux of the narrative. The story boils down to a struggle for subjectivity as Simon attempts to withdraw from symbiotic union with his mother in order to forge an independent identity. This is a trajectory which we can trace in <em>El Orfanato</em> (see above). 
                             In the beginning, "Laura's comforting of Simon promptly sets up the mother-son bond, as well as key themes in the film - game-playing and make-believe" (ibid: 229). Yet the game turns sour when Simon runs away to be with his invisible friends following an argument with his mother... I pay particular attention to this "oedipal trajectory" in the <a href = "#">full version of my dissertation</a>.

    <h2><em>Hierro</em> (Ibanez 2009)</h2>
      <p>Writing in <em>Screen Daily</em>, Hunter claims that <em>Hierro</em> reinforces Spain's reputation as a "breeding ground for classy supernatural tales" (2009). While Wilkinson in <em>Eye for Film</em> refers to it as an addition to <strong>the Spanish sub-genre of "is she nuts or not?"</strong> (2010). Indeed it is true that Hierro covers "similar emotional ground to The Orphanage", whilst being remniscient of "superior Hollywood fare such as <em>Flightplan</em> and <em>The Changeling</em>" (ibid), with its <strong>traumatic lost-child trope.</strong></br>
        <em>Hierro</em> may not be original in its plot, as many critics have been quick to point out. But horror as a genre seems to feast on repetition anyway, digesting and spitting out the same themes which disturb and engross the collective consciousness. 
          </br> 
            If not a revolutionary plot, <em>Hierro</em> does have a somewhat avant-garde aesthetic. Its fascination with water is, of course, nothing new in the Horror World, as Coghlan rightly observes in <em>The Arts Desk</em> (2010). Yet Hierro goes one step further than the rest, taking traditional horror imagery to a new, arthouse level. Because the spectator shares the viewpoint of the protagonist, Maria (Elena Anaya), through the middle section of the film, coinciding with her mental decline, this allows for haunting, fantastical imagery from her nightmares and darkest thoughts to be superimposed upon "the real". <strong>The terror is in her madness and the unease is a result of her unstable viewpoint.</strong> <br>
              Along with these elements of fantastical realism, the film uses setting to great effect as a mirror for the psychology of its characters. For instance, the eponymous island of El Hierro is in fact Europe's southernmost point. Whilst venturing to the geographical margins of European civilisation, our protagonist is toppled over the brink of sanity. The coastal wilderness in <em>El orfanato</em> achieves a similar effect, as it did in Hitchcock's <em>Rebecca</em> at the dawn of the psychological thriller genre (1940). In fact, <em>Hierro</em> is decidedly Hitchcockean with its recurring motif of a flock of seabirds, now a codified symbol of ominous threat in cinema. <br>
                Bitel resumes it nicely in his review for <em>Film4</em> (2009):
                  <blockquote>
                    <em>Hierro</em> is never quite fresh enough to isolate itself from <strong>the whole archipelago of maternity-and-madness thrillers</strong>, but what it lacks in originality it makes up for in pure filmmaking craft and atmospheric use of location. 
                      </blockquote>
                        So while <em>Hierro</em> was actually marketed as a horror film (Sutton 2010), no doubt to cash in on the successful track records of its scarier predecessors, it is much more slow-moving and psychologically poignant than its counterparts, only loosely fitting into the horror genre, presumably because this associtation was more economically viable.

   <h2><em> Los ojos de Julia</em> (Morales 2010)</h2>
    <p> "Horror event movies, such as <em>El orfanato</em> and <em>Los ojos de Julia</em>, reflect changes in industrial practices and reach mainstream audiences" (L-R: 271). These "industrial practices" include following Hollywood genre conventions and aggressive marketing campaigns involving transnational collaborations to boost widespread appeal and create an internationally-recognisable "brand" of Hispanic Horror. <br>
      Like <em>El orfanato</em>, <em>Los ojos</em> benefited from the patronage of Del Toro; he co-produced the film with Barcelona-based production company Rodar y Rodar. <em>Los Ojos</em> (<em>Julia's Eyes</em>) therefore replicated "the marketing template and quality production values that proved so effective in <em>El orfanato</em>" (ibid: 230). <em>Los ojos</em> only grossed 7 million euros - less than a third of <a href = "#">the takings for <em>El orfanato</em></a>. Yet it is clear that these films "owe their commercial success to the role played by their respective production and distribution companies" which "mediated the reception of the films" (ibid: 231).</br>
        Because of their mainstream appeal, these films are often perceived as part of a "purely commercial film culture" (ibid: 231). But this does not mean they are unworthy of deeper analysis. On the contrary, <strong>their archetypal references to the inner-workings of the human mind invest them with universal appeal</strong>. <br>
         It goes without saying that theories related to the <a href = "#"> scopophilic gaze</a> are particularly applicable to <em>Los ojos</em> with its narrative centred upon the female protagonist's ocular disease, in conjunction with her pursuer's desire to not be looked at. This is an aspect of the film which I analyse in-depth as part of <a href = "#">my dissertation.</a>

   <h2>Mientras Duermes (Balaguero 2011)</h2>
    <p>
     "Balaguero, whose name has been closely associated with Filmax and the Fantastic Factory, has been producing competitive products for the international commercial horror film market" (ibid: 234) and <em>Mientras Duermes</em> (<em>Sleep Tight</em>) is one of them, along with the <em>[REC]</em> saga, <em>Fragiles</em>, and <em>Darkness</em>. The director has been described as a "horror auteur", having transitioned from the margins to the mainstream as Horror grew in popularity. It is in this context that he progressively cultivated the unique style exemplified in <em>Mientras Duermes</em>...
       <blockquote>
         Balaguero's trajectory over the last two decades can leave us in no doubt about his horror credentials and is concurrent with major developments and trends in the field of contemporary Spanish horror [...] <br>
          Balaguero's career, therefore has been devoted to the horror genre and its revival. For all these reasons Balaguero is seen as a horror auteur [...]<br>
           Balaguero aligns himself with horror auteurs such as David Cronenberg and Dario Argento [...] <br>
            The reputation of Balaguero as a cult and horror connoisseur was cemented in his fanzine Zineshock [...]<br>
             By the mid-1990s, then, Balaguero was an established name on the fanzine scene and his horror pedigree was indisputable [...]<br>
               But Balaguero's commitment to alternative culture and 'obscure and brutal' traditions of horror did not mean that he rejected film as a commercial venture [...]<br>
                references to Balaguero as a fan and (commerical) horror auteur that had been circulating in fanzine publications eventually seeped through into mainstream journalism with te arrival of fanzine writers into mainstream media [...]
                 Alarcon credits Balaguero with <strong>physical and psychological torture, in particular that of children, an investigation into pure evil and the horrors of the past, and 'a dark vision of human existence'</strong>, all conveyed through recurrent visual imagery (old photographs, medical paraphenalia, the presence of bodily fluids and water), cinemtaography and editing style [...] <br>- (ibid: 245-8)</blockquote>
                   In <em>Mientras Duermes</em>, it seems that the director is "searching for <strong>new ways of scaring audiences</strong>" (ibid: 254). He expressed a desire to use more sophisticated techniques of the genre following <em>[REC]</em> and <em>[REC]2</em>, which lack the subtlety of <em>Mientras</em>...
                   <blockquote>
                     [In <em>Mientras</em>,] Balaguero's deployment of the mechanics of the thriller and suspense genres has been favourably received by Spanish critics, whose textual and cinematic references hint at a coming-of-age auteurism <br>
                      (ibid: 255) </blockquote>

   <h2>The <em>[REC]</em> Saga (Balaguero and Plaza 2007 and 2009, Plaza 2012, Balaguero 2014)</h2>
    <p>
      Balaguero combined forces with Paco Plaza to co-direct the <em>[REC]</em> series, which has become "the <strong>first horror franchise to come out of Spain</strong>" (ibid: 271). Interestingly, the film distinguished itself and owes a lot of success to marketing and promotion through social media with a trailer which went viral on Youtube. <br>
        The film represents "yet another offspring of the zombie/infected subgenre, as well as a variation on the contemporary 'reality horror' subgenre" (ibid: 274) which we know from productions such as the <em>Blair Witch</em> project (Myrick and Sanchez 1999). <em>[REC]</em> was in fact inspired by contemporary 'reality TV' shows in Spain (ibid: 274). <br>
         Despite a new age approach, the overarching plotlines of the series echo those of previous films I have mentioned; "[t]he <em>[REC]</em> saga, like horror film in general, promises more of the same but different" (ibid: 275). <strong>With a female protagonist at its heart, <em>[REC]</em> links femininity with disease and disaster and a fatal quest for a solution. Sound familiar? </strong <br>
          In <a href = "#">my dissertation</a>, I take a close look at Balaguero's <em>[REC]4: Apocalypse</em>, the most recent addition to the series.

    <h2>Transnational Horror</h2>
      <p>
       <em>Regression</em>(Amenabar 2015) <br>
         <em>Crimson Peak</em> (Del Toro 2015) <br>
          N.B. I made a conscious choice to omit Guillermo Del Toro's "Spanish trilogy" (including <em>Pan's Labyrinth</em>(2006)) for several reasons, despite the major influence these films have undoubtedly had on Spanish cinema: <br>
            1. it enables me to focus purely on films made by Spanish directors, narrowing the cultural focus to a national level while still taking into account attempts to appeal to foreign markets; <br>
             2. it also means that I can focus on films with adult females for protagonists rather than children (this theme deserves its own research paper); <br>
               3. Del Toro's films are best described as "horror-related" rather than horror <em>in se</em>, and they are not characteristic of the Hitchcockean psychological thriller, which means that they don't fit into the hybrid genre (Horror/Psychological Thriller) which has become my point of study and is so pertinent to <em>Spanish</em> cinema today.
